A database management app written in Python that uses the sqlite3 database engine. Designed for a bookstore clerk to use.

An Sqlite database file is created which stores book information. The fields are: bookID, title, author and quantity.

Database connections are properly opened and closed to prevent resource leaks and ensure data integrity.

User input is driven by SQL statements and queries that allow the user to add, delete and update stock.

The database can be viewed separately using DB Browser for SQlite.
